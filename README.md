#Mini Dictionary App (Python Project)

This is a simple dictionary app made using Python,Tkinter,ttkbootstrap,and the requests module.
The user can type any English word, and the meaning will be shown on the screen.  
I used a free online API for fetching meanings:  
https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/

#Requirements / Modules Used

```bash
pip install ttkbootstrap
pip install requests

Also, Tkinter is already available with Python.


#How to Run the Program:

1. Open the folder where the file is saved.
2. Double-click the file dictionary_app.py
OR run it in terminal:
python dictionary_app.py
3. Type a word and click Search (or press Enter).


#My Learning from This Project:

How to create a GUI (Graphical User Interface) in Python
How to use API to get real data from the internet
How to use try–except for errors (no internet, wrong word, etc.)
How to use ttkbootstrap for better theme and design

#Future Improvements (Ideas):

Voice input (say a word instead of typing)
Offline dictionary using a local file
Save history of searched words
Pronunciation of the word
